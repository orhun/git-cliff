## What's new? ‚õ∞Ô∏è

The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

---

### üåÄ Submodule Support

**git-cliff** now supports submodules! You can recurse into submodules and generate changelogs for them as well.

Just set the following option in your configuration file:

```toml
[git]
recurse_submodules = true
```

And then you can use the `submodule_commits` template variable to access the commits of submodules as follows:

```toml
[changelog]
body = """
{% for submodule_path, commits in submodule_commits %}
    ### {{ submodule_path | upper_first }}
    {% for group, commits in commits | group_by(attribute="group") %}
        #### {{ group | upper_first }}
        {% for commit in commits %}
            - {{ commit.message | upper_first }}\
        {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}\n
"""
```

Thanks [@lehmanju](https://github.com/lehmanju) for the implementation in [#1082](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/1082)!

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Conventional commit check

**git-cliff** can now check if the commits in the repository follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

To enable this check, set the `require_conventional` option in your configuration file:

```toml
[git]
require_conventional = true
```

If any unconventional commits are found, an error will be thrown and the changelog generation will fail.

---

### üõ∞Ô∏è Remote config

Have a configuration file elsewhere on the internet? No probs.

```bash
$ git cliff --config-url https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/examples/github-keepachangelog.toml?raw=true
```

The new `--config-url` option allows you to specify a URL to a configuration file!

---

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Commit range variable

The template context now includes a `commit_range` variable that contains the range of commits that were used to generate the changelog.

Can be used as follows:

```
{{ commit_range.from }}..{{ commit_range.to }}

```

Results in:

```
a140cef0405e0bcbfb5de44ff59e091527d91b38..a9d4050212a18f6b3bd76e2e41fbb9045d268b80
```

:::tip

You can use the [`truncate`](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#truncate) filter to shorten the commit range:

```jinja
{{ commit_range.from | truncate(length=7, end="") }}..{{ commit_range.to | truncate(length=7, end="") }}
```

Results in:

```
a140cef..a9d4050
```

### üåø Better branch support

**git-cliff** used to only support the default branches of the remotes (e.g., `main` branch on GitHub).

Now, it can fetch commits from the correct branch automatically based on the commit range that you provide.

For example:

```bash
$ git cliff v1.0.0..v1.0.1 --github-repo my-org/my-private-repo
```

This command used to default to the `main` branch of the `my-org/my-private-repo` repository. Now, it will use the `v1.1` branch thus using the correct commits for the changelog.

Similarly:

```bash
$ git cliff 9f66ac0f76..89de5e8e50 --gitlab-repo my-org/my-private-repo
```

The changelog will contains commits up to the commit `89de5e8e50`.

Thanks to [@william-stacken](https://github.com/william-stacken) for the implementation in [#1086](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/1086)!

### üî¢ Disable topological sorting

The topological sorting of commits can now be disabled by setting the `topological_sort` option to `false` in your configuration file:

```toml
[git]
topo_order_commits = false
```

- If `false`, the commits will be sorted in the order they were committed, without considering their parent-child relationships.
  - This is equivalent to running `git log`.
- Otherwise, if `true` (default), the commits will be sorted topologically, which means that the commits will be ordered in such a way that all parent commits come before their children.
  - This is equivalent to running `git log --topo-order`.

### üõ°Ô∏è Remove tj-actions

There was a security issue reported in the [tj-actions organization](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/popular-github-action-tj-actionschanged-files-is-compromised/).

There is also a GitHub Action created for **git-cliff**: [tj-actions/git-cliff](https://github.com/tj-actions/git-cliff).

The action seems to be unaffected by the compromise, but I have removed all the references to it from the documentation and the website for safety.

> [**git-cliff**](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) is a command-line tool (written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) that provides a highly customizable way to generate changelogs from git history.
>
> It supports using [custom regular expressions](/docs/configuration/git#commit_parsers) to alter changelogs which are mostly based on [conventional commits](/docs/configuration/git#conventional_commits). With a single [configuration file](/docs/configuration), a wide variety of formats can be applied for a changelog, thanks to the Jinja2/Django-inspired [template engine](/docs/category/templating).
>
> More information and examples can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff).

## What's new? ‚õ∞Ô∏è

The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Deprecated integration fields

The following fields are deprecated and will be removed in the next releases:

- `commit.github`, `commit.gitea`, `commit.gitlab`, `commit.bitbucket`

You can now use the `commit.remote` field instead. For example:

```diff
-{% if commit.github.username %}
+{% if commit.remote.username %}
```

---

### üå≤ Better branch support

If you have diverged branches for your project and want to changelog for each branch, you can now use the `--use-branch-tags` option.

```bash
$ git cliff --use-branch-tags
```

The generated changelog above will only include the tags from the current branch.

Also, you can use it from the configuration file:

```toml
[git]
use_branch_tags  = true
```

:::info

See the [implementation](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/772) for more explanation and the coolest hand-drawn diagram ever!

---

### ‚ôæÔ∏è Render always

Do you want to always render the changelog even if there are no changes? Boom, now you can now use the `render_always` option:

```toml
[changelog]
render_always = true
```

---

### üì§ Output from configuration

This is pretty self-explanatory:

```toml
[changelog]
output = "CHANGELOG.md"
```

This option does not take precedence over command-line arguments which means you can override it with the `--output` option.

---

### üì¶ Improve Typescript API

We added the missing options and documented all options with tsdoc comments.

Also, we improved the `skipCommit` option to accept an array of values.

:::info

See the [implementation](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/843) for more information.

---

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Trim commit messages

We now remove the trailing newline for commits, which means you can use `$` anchor in your regular expressions:

```toml
[git]
commit_preprocessors = [
  # remove the issue number at the end of the commit message (e.g. #123)
  { pattern = ' #\d+$', replace = ""}
]
```

---

### üåü Better example templates

The example templates are now more intuitive and conventionally correct. We removed the non-beginner-friendly options and changed the defaults to be easier to start with. Weheee!

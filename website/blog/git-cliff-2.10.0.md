## What's new? ‚õ∞Ô∏è

The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

---

### üìà Release statistics

**git-cliff** now supports adding various release-related metrics to the changelog via `statistics` variable!

You can use it in your template as follows:

```toml
[changelog]
body = """
### Commit Statistics

- {{ statistics.commit_count }} commit(s) contributed to the release.
- {{ statistics.commits_timespan | default(value=0) }} day(s) passed between the first and last commit.
- {{ statistics.conventional_commit_count }} commit(s) parsed as conventional.
- {{ statistics.links | length }} linked issue(s) detected in commits.

{%- for link in statistics.links %}
      {{ "  " }}- [{{ link.text }}]({{ link.href }}) (referenced {{ link.count }} time(s))
{%- endfor %}

- {{ statistics.days_passed_since_last_release }} day(s) passed between releases.

"""
```

This will render a section like this in the changelog:

```markdown
## Commit Statistics

- 5 commit(s) contributed to the release.
- 0 day(s) passed between the first and last commit.
- 5 commit(s) parsed as conventional.
- 3 linked issue(s) detected in commits.
  - [#452](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/issues/452) (referenced 2 time(s))
  - [#1148](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/issues/1148) (referenced 1 time(s))
  - [ietf-rfc3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986) (referenced 1 time(s))
- 1430 day(s) passed between releases.
```

See [release statistics](/docs/templating/context#release-statistics) for the available variables and more details.

Thanks to [Shingo OKAWA](https://github.com/ognis1205) for the implementation in [#1151](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/1151)!

### üìù New template

Related to the new statistics feature, we added a new built-in template called [`statistics.toml`](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/examples/statistics.toml)!

It can be used as follows:

```bash
$ git cliff --config statistics
```

To initialize `cliff.toml` with it:

```bash
$ git cliff --init statistics

 INFO  git_cliff > Saving the configuration file (statistics) to "cliff.toml"
```

It serves the purpose of providing a basic template that includes release statistics. You can use it as a starting point for your own changelog template or simply use it as is.

---

### üìÅ Include/exclude paths in config

As highly requested, you can now include or exclude specific paths in your changelog generation via the [`include_paths`](/docs/configuration/git#include_paths) and [`exclude_paths`](/docs/configuration/git#exclude_paths) options in the configuration file.

```
[git]
include_paths = ["src/", "doc/**/*.md"]
exclude_paths = ["unrelated/"]
```

These options are the same as providing `--include-paths` and `--exclude-paths` command line arguments.

Thanks to [@Kriskras99](https://github.com/Kriskras99) for implementing this in [#1173](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/1173)!

---

### üßÆ Support matching arrays via parsers

The commit parser has been extended to support regex matching on array values, such as `remote.pr_labels`.

For example, this makes it possible to group commits based on their GitHub labels as follows:

```toml
[git]
commit_parsers = [
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "duplicate|invalid|wontfix|skip changelog", skip = true },
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "breaking change", group = "<!-- 0 -->üèóÔ∏è Breaking Changes" },
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "feature|deprecation", group = "<!-- 1 -->üöÄ Features" },
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "enhancement|refactor", group = "<!-- 1 -->üõ†Ô∏è Enhancements" },
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "bug|regression", group = "<!-- 2 -->üêõ Bug Fixes" },
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "security", group = "<!-- 3 -->üîê Security" },
  { field = "remote.pr_labels", pattern = "documentation", group = "<!-- 4 -->üìù Documentation" },
  { message = ".*", group = "<!-- 5 -->üåÄ Miscellaneous" },
]
```

---

### üóëÔ∏è Empty header/footer as default

In the previous release, we internally started initializing the configuration file with default values. This sadly made it impossible to render a changelog without a header or footer.

This behavior has been reverted in this release and the default values for `[changelog.header]` and `[changelog.footer]` are now empty. Meaning that the following is a minimal configuration that will render a changelog without a header or footer:

```toml
[changelog]
body = """
{% if version %}\
    ## {{ version | trim_start_matches(pat="v") }} - {{ timestamp | date(format="%Y-%m-%d") }}\
{% else %}\
    ## Unreleased\
{% endif %}\
{% for group, commits in commits | group_by(attribute="group") %}
    ### {{ group | upper_first }}
    {% for commit in commits %}\
        - {% if commit.breaking %}[**breaking**] {% endif %}{{ commit.message | upper_first }}
    {% endfor %}\
{% endfor %}\n
"""
```

---

### üêß Gentoo support

**git-cliff** made its way into the [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/) package repository! üéâ

It can be installed via the following command:

```bash
emerge git-cliff
```

See the package page [here](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-vcs/git-cliff).

Thanks to [@aspann](https://github.com/aspann) for packaging!

### üè¥ Spaces instead of tabs

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRva7UxGQDw?si=GZUdkxKZHjrzZ6OG" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

**git-cliff** now uses [spaces instead of tabs](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/issues/1184) throughout the codebase! This change made the code more consistent with the Rust community's conventions and improved readability.

:::info[Fun Fact]

Hard tabs are used in around [0.1% of Rust projects](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/pull/1184#issue-3164547412). I don't know why I went with that config option when I first started this project. I guess I was a rebel back then.

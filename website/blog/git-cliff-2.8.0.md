> [**git-cliff**](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) is a command-line tool (written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) that provides a highly customizable way to generate changelogs from git history.
>
> It supports using [custom regular expressions](/docs/configuration/git#commit_parsers) to alter changelogs which are mostly based on [conventional commits](/docs/configuration/git#conventional_commits). With a single [configuration file](/docs/configuration), a wide variety of formats can be applied for a changelog, thanks to the Jinja2/Django-inspired [template engine](/docs/category/templating).
>
> More information and examples can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff).

## What's new? ‚õ∞Ô∏è

Happy new year! This version of **git-cliff** comes with quality of life improvements and bug fixes.

The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

---

### üî• Improved Monorepo Support

There were numerous improvements to the monorepo support in this release:

1. **git-cliff** now _discovers_ the Git repositories automatically even though when you run from sub directories.

2. The configuration file is now _automatically found_ when running from a sub directory.

3. The `include-path` is now _automatically set_ to the current directory when running from a sub directory.

As a result, the following command:

```bash
$ cd packages/some_library

$ git cliff --include-path "packages/some_library/**/*" --repository "../../"
```

becomes:

```bash
$ cd packages/some_library

$ git cliff # just works!
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è Native TLS Support

**git-cliff** now supports enabling native TLS for remote requests. This is useful when you rely on a corporate trust root (e.g., for a mandatory proxy) that's included in your system's certificate store.

To enable it:

```bash
$ git cliff --use-native-tls
```

Or configure it in your `cliff.toml`:

```toml
[remote.gitlab]
owner = "archlinux"
repo = "arch-repro-status"
api_url = "https://gitlab.archlinux.org/api/v4"
native_tls = true
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Custom Config Name

You can now specify a custom filename for the configuration while initializing **git-cliff**:

```bash
$ git-cliff --init --config custom.toml
```

---

### üö® Better Errors

Before:

```
$ git cliff test
 ERROR git_cliff > Git error: `unable to parse OID - contains invalid characters; class=Invalid (3)`
```

After:

```
$ git cliff test
 ERROR git_cliff > Failed to set the commit range: unable to parse OID - contains invalid characters; class=Invalid (3)
"test" is not a valid commit range. Did you provide the correct arguments?
```

---

### üîÑ Run with Callback API

If you are using **git-cliff** in your Rust project as a library, you can now run it with a callback function to modify the changelog before it's printed:

```rust
use clap::Parser;
use git_cliff::args::Opt;
use git_cliff_core::error::Result;

fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let args = Opt::parse();

    git_cliff::run_with_changelog_modifier(args, |changelog| {
        println!("Releases: {:?}", changelog.releases);
        Ok(())
    })?;

    Ok(())
}
```

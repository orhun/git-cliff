> [**git-cliff**](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff) is a command-line tool (written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)) that provides a highly customizable way to generate changelogs from git history.
>
> It supports using [custom regular expressions](/docs/configuration/git#commit_parsers) to alter changelogs which are mostly based on [conventional commits](/docs/configuration/git#conventional_commits). With a single [configuration file](/docs/configuration), a wide variety of formats can be applied for a changelog, thanks to the Jinja2/Django-inspired [template engine](/docs/category/templating).
>
> More information and examples can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff).

### ü¶ä GitLab Integration

`git-cliff` now supports integrating with repositories hosted on GitLab (gitlab.com or your own instance)!

This means that you can now use the following variables in your changelog:

- GitLab usernames (`${{ commit.gitlab.username }}` or `${{ contributor.username }}`)
- Contributors list (`${{ gitlab.contributors }}`)
- Pull requests (`${{ commit.gitlab.pr_number }}` or `${{ contributor.pr_number }}`)

Which means you can generate a changelog entries like the following:

```md
## What's Changed

- feat(commit): add merge_commit flag to the context by @orhun in !389
- test(fixture): add test fixture for bumping version by @orhun in !360

## New Contributors

- @someone made their first contribution in !360
- @cliffjumper made their first contribution in !389

<!-- generated by git-cliff -->
```

To set up `git-cliff` for your project, simply:

1. Check out the [quickstart guide](https://git-cliff.org/docs/) for installation / initialization.
1. Set up the [Git remote](https://git-cliff.org/docs/configuration/remote/) for your GitLab project.
1. Update the changelog configuration to use the [template variables](https://git-cliff.org/docs/integration/gitlab/).

:::tip

See the [GitLab integration](https://git-cliff.org/docs/integration/gitlab) for detailed documentation and usage examples. It works very similar to the [GitHub integration](https://git-cliff.org/docs/integration/github).

### üìò Bitbucket Integration

`git-cliff` now supports integrating with repositories hosted on Bitbucket!

It works similarly with GitHub and GitLab integrations. See the [documentation](https://git-cliff.org/docs/integration/bitbucket) for details and usage examples.

Big thanks to [dark0dave](https://github.com/dark0dave) for the [contribution](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/issues/654)!

### üì§ Output to stdout

Using `-` for `stdout` is common among CLI tools and `git-cliff` now supports this!

```sh
$ git-cliff -o -
```

You can simply use `-` instead instead of `-o /dev/stdout`. It can also be used in conjunction with `-p` argument as mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff/issues/643).
